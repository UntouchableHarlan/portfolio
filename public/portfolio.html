    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Who am I? I'm Salomon Pluviose and I'm from Miami, FL. I originally come from a Haitain background. If you don't know by now, I am a Developer. I have experience with web and mobile development. Right now I am fully focused on web development but in 2017 I will be open to iOS and Android development. I am an extremely passionate guy as my hobbies are programming and playing basketball. How I got into programming? Well, I used to try to mak computers do things they weren't supposed to do back in high school. I did bad thing such as unblock games on school computers and even tryed to hack my teachers computer. I played sports and did events in high school to stay away from gang violence and drugs as the way I grew up wasn't the best. I'm trying to use computers as a way out, as I love doing things like building programs that people use. My dreams for the future? Not really sure what I want but I do know my life long dream is to sit court side at a LA Clippers game before Chris Paul retiresüòÅ. What nest describes me? I'm a person who loves to laugh and goof off all the time. There's never a dull moment with me. Although, I'm goofy, don't let that mislead you. I'm a hard working indivisual that gets it done. If you give it to me, guaranteed it's going to be finish no matter what. If you ask any one of my peers, I'm always working on my craft as a developer and always willing to learn something new because technology never stops</p>

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>My skills vary as a web developer. I love to mess around with Ruby and Javascript as those are my favorite languages. Therefore I'm skilled at the frameworks Ruby on Rails and Ember.js. Although Ember.js is not used as much, I found to like it and very common as Ruby on Rails. I also can do frontend HTML and CSS to make beautiful websites as I am very comfortable with Bootstrap. As a person I am a firm believer in AGILE and LEAN methods when working on a project. I enjoy building cool stuff as a passion and I always have fun doing it. Below you can find the projects that I haved worked on if you click the projects button. I'm still a kid looking to grow not only as a developer but as a person. If you want to contact me, you can shoot me an email or DM me on Twitter. Check out my Githubüòé</p>
